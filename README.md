## Project Overview

Creative coding is a concept where one moves away from creating a program for purposes of accomplishing a task. Intead it focuses on reflecting one's own perspective and thoughts throhgh their code. This project aimed at accomplishing these objectives by building a interaction based program that allows one to interact through taking in the musical graphic syncronization queues implemented by integrating the Web Audio API to allowing users to affect the shape and size of objects in the project by tracking their hands. The following was the description that accompanied the project during its display at a Creative Coding exhibition: 

Interaction with Graphics is a multimedia installation that immerses the audience in the virtual 
realm of computer graphics through auditory, visual, and interactive queues. This time sequenced 
project, which is entirely written in Javascript with a library called ThreeJS, implements a 
variety of abstract and structured sequences, all of which demonstrate mathematical and 
programming achievements made in the last 30 years, such as perlin noise and sophisticated 
3-dimensional model rendering. The main objective of this endeavor is to remind its audience 
of the past while demonstrating what the future holds.

# Plug and Play

This project is one that is currently not available to run in the browser due to the number of files
and CORS restrictions. To Plug and Play this project you will need to clone this project to your local 
environment and run the main.html file on a local host server that is configured in your IDE. Visual Studio
Code has a great 'Live Server' plugin that makes set-up and running this repo's code a breeze. 

Steps: 
- 1. Clone the project to your local environment
- 2. Open this project in your IDE (Recommended: Visual Studio Code)
- 3. Launch Live Server and Choose Main.html to start
- 4. Follow the on screen prompts and enjoy!!

Please know that this assignment was one of experimental origin and was made to run specifically on 
a newer device within its local environment. If you experience problems getting things set up and running
please contact me with your questions and concerns. 


Creative coding is a concept where one moves away from creating a program for purposes of accomplishing a task. Instead it focuses on reflecting one's own perspective and thoughts through their code. This project aimed at accomplishing these tasks by building a interaction based project that allows one to take in and eventually interact with a virtual environment in a couple of different ways. They include through sight, sound and hand tracking. This project utilized a 3D JavaScript library called Three.js to accomplish the graphics while relying on a JS library called Handsfree.js for the hand tracking. If you have a moment this project is one that I would certainly recommend checking out.
