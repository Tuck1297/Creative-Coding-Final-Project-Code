## Project Overview

Creative coding is a concept where one moves away from creating a program for purposes of accomplishing a task. Intead it focuses on reflecting one's own perspective and thoughts throhgh their code. This project aimed at accomplishing these objectives by building a interaction based program that allows one to interact through taking in the musical graphic syncronization queues implemented by integrating the Web Audio API to allowing users to affect the shape and size of objects in the project by tracking their hands. The following was the description that accompanied the project during its display at a Creative Coding exhibition: 

Interaction with Graphics is a multimedia installation that immerses the audience in the virtual 
realm of computer graphics through auditory, visual, and interactive queues. This time sequenced 
project, which is entirely written in Javascript with a library called ThreeJS, implements a 
variety of abstract and structured sequences, all of which demonstrate mathematical and 
programming achievements made in the last 30 years, such as perlin noise and sophisticated 
3-dimensional model rendering. The main objective of this endeavor is to remind its audience 
of the past while demonstrating what the future holds.
