## Creative Coding Final Project - Spring 2021 Semester
University of St. Thomas

# Description
 Interaction with Graphics is a multimedia installation that immerses the audience in the virtual 
 realm of computer graphics through auditory, visual, and interactive queues. This time sequenced 
 project, which is entirely written in Javascript with a library called ThreeJS, implements a 
 variety of abstract and structured sequences, all of which demonstrate mathematical and 
 programming achievements made in the last 30 years, such as perlin noise and sophisticated 
 3-dimensional model rendering. The main objective of this endeavor is to remind its audience 
 of the past while demonstrating what the future holds.

The interactive queues implemented in this assignment include musical graphic syncronization
by using Web Audio API and hand interaction through the library called HandsFree. 

# Plug and Play

This project is one that I currently do not have available to run in the browser hosted on Github 
due to there being CORS restrictions and errors that surface. Therefore, to plug and play this project
you will need to clone this project to your browser and run the local host server that is configured
in your IDE. Visual Studio Code has great 'Live Server' plugins that make step-up and running this 
repo's code a breeze. 

Please know that this assignment was one of experimental origin and was made to run specifically on 
a newer device within its local environment. If you experience problems getting things set up and running
please contact me with your questions and concerns.
