# Description
 Interaction with Graphics is a multimedia installation that immerses the audience in the virtual 
 realm of computer graphics through auditory, visual, and interactive queues. This time sequenced 
 project, which is entirely written in Javascript with a library called ThreeJS, implements a 
 variety of abstract and structured sequences, all of which demonstrate mathematical and 
 programming achievements made in the last 30 years, such as perlin noise and sophisticated 
 3-dimensional model rendering. The main objective of this endeavor is to remind its audience 
 of the past while demonstrating what the future holds.

The interactive queues implemented in this assignment include musical graphic syncronization
by using Web Audio API and hand interaction through the library called HandsFree.
